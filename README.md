## OpenRASE: Service Function Chain Emulation

| Data Directory | Description |
|---|---|
| [experiment_server_20_07_2024](openrase_softcom/experiment_server_20_07_2024) | Data generated during the online evolution performed on OpenRASE using a Genetic Algorithm. |
| [experiment_server_03_06_2024](openrase_softcom/experiment_server_03_06_2024) | Data generated during the experiment that was conducted to demonstrate OpenRASE's ability to provide a dynamic network environment. This makes use of the Simple Dijkstra algorithm. This also includes experiment data generated on ALEVIN.  |
